# Numerical-Solution-of-Kepler-s-problem
One of science's great achievements was the discovery of Kepler's laws for planetary motion; in particular, that the planets follow closed elliptical orbits around the sun.


Part 1
The position of a moving planet towards to
another fixed planet. In this diagram, the smallest or the inner
ellipse is the original track of this moving planet. With time
increasing, this diagram shows the moving track of this planet starts
expanding to right side slowly but the track is still ellipse. In the
other world, the shape of moving track is always ellipse whose
center moving to left side slowing and Semi-major axis increases
slowly as well. The right side of the moving track does not have
great change.

Part 2
Symplectic Euler method provides a closed ellipse solution which illustrates both motion and position are always conserved.This planet has fixed traveling track which is not influnced by time.  In Symplectic Euler method, the angular momentum of this planet conserves 0.8 and its Hamiltonian conserves at -0.5 with small oscillation. In Standard Euler's method, the numerical solution does not convers. Part 2 also prooves that planet's Hamiltonian and angular momentum does not conserve.

(In the 3 above graph, blue plot represents Symplectic Euler method and the red plot representes standard Euler's method. I
combined them together to bring a great comparison.)
